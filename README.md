<div align="center"><h3 align="center">Technologies used in this app</h3>

<li> <b>Flutter/dart</b> For mobile app front end<br></li>
<li> <b>Firebase</b> For database (and auth at a later point).<br></li>
<li> <b>Solidity/web3</b> You'll see the contracts folder and .sol file, however I decided against pursuing that as there are real time constraints. <br></li>

You must have the flutter sdk installed if you are testing this from source.Flutter allows you to write code once and deploy to multiple devices, it is hardware Agnostic. More about flutter here: <https://flutter.dev/>

 I will sends you an apk file if needed. This app runs firebase for datastorage. Login will be added at a later date as well as payments and even alternative payments in crypto. I can write solidity smart contracts and know how to use the blockchain.

## As for my personal setup

- I run on a mac M1, iPhone XS Max and xcode simulator.

- VSCode is my IDE of choice. I avoid Android Studio and XCode at all costs.

- I don't own an android and have not tested my project on Android simulator. However this project is Android compatible. I have set it up to work on Android with my signing keys just in case. If needed I will send an APK file over!

# A bit about the problem and my personal understanding and interest in the matter

Exposure therapy is a technique used by therapists to help people overcome fears and anxieties by breaking the pattern of fear and avoidance. This format of therapy can be controversial due to its confrontational approach and the fact that it can trigger servere anxiety. It's important to stress that the recipient must be a willing participant and adaquate trigger warnings are given and things are staged correctly.

Over a quarter of the people in Canada will have an anxiety disorder or depression within their lifetime.Exposure-based behavioral therapies are effective treatments for these disorders.However only a small percentage of patients are treated with exposure therapy.

Admittedly I'm not the biggest fan of addressing psychiatric issues solely using an app,to me that's just as cringe as depending on TV psychologists to solve your issue. Yes the TV psychologists are real DRs(and often are generally interesting people), however getting 1- on -1 care is of the utmost importance when it comes to these issues.

However, I do think these apps CAN be used as tools in addition to counselling and medication. Most importantly it sometimes helps to be able to take "baby steps" on your own terms. Some people might see a therapist or dr on a regular basis but appointments are only so long. Also many people have anxiety and need to be able to work on their psychiatric issues on their own time. I think things like TV psychologists, books, tv shows and apps have their own important roles to play in helping people navigate mental health issues. while these things cannot replace seeing a Dr, they can aid in a theraputic plan or encourage seeking help in the first place.

I am personally aware of these issues as I have multiple psychiatric disorders myself and take medications. I've also attempted exposure therapy on myself and it didn't go too well. Plus I majored in Psychology and minored in comp sci at Trent University!

## How I ranked the photos

I found 10 photos of rats and 10 of spiders and tried to rank them as objectively as I could for intensity of fear. With the rats you'll notice that 1-5 are pics of pet rats that are extremely friendly looking. 9-10 are the stuff of nightmares! I applied the same approach to the spiders in rank ordering them.

If I were to grow this app I would ideally curate data from users and have a more dynamic approach to rankings.
